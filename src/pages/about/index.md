Thanks so much for checking out our website! We are two nerd BFFs with (permanent) benefits who wanted to share our thoughts, musings, feelings about travel, food, geekdom, and other random things. We will be traveling across Asia and Europe from October 2019 until around August 2020. Check-in for updates about where we're visiting. Also, check out our youtube for travel vlogs once we figure out the beast that is editing.
