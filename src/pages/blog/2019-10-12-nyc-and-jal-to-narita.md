October 4-7, 2019

New York was a short couple days. We had planned on using Alaska points to buy tickets to tokyo, and knew award seats open up last minute. However, that week was particularly busy (maybe due to the rugby thing going on?) and we had to last minute change our flight date to october 7th. Thankfully the Roxy refunded us a night, and we were able to change our plans.

We enjoyed afternoon tea at the Plaza hotel and Brandon was excited to learn how many movies have been filmed there (like Home Alone 2). The atrium was gorgeous, called “The Palm Court”. Afterwards we strolled through central park and saw Strawberry Fields.

Later that night we saw Hamilton.

Then wrapped up the evening at the Roxy hotel where we got into their speakeasy-like club for free due to staying at the hotel. Super awesome band playing, and the drinks were tasty and stiff, although a bit on the pricy side (20$ each).

The next day we had difficulty leaving our hotel, exhausted from walking 7 miles the day before. We worked out, had an amazing brunch at the Roxy (i’d go back just for the brunch, which included grapefruit brulee yummm). Then saw Book of Mormon that night.

The next morning we woke up hella early and took off for Tokyo. We snagged two business class seats with alaska points, but it flew out of O’Hare. Regardless, we felt it was worth it. It was our first time in lie-flat seats. We felt like kids with our enjoyment of everything lol. I liked how they give you a sweater and slippers too. We flew JAL and their service and food were incredible.

Pabu also enjoyed our accommodations. Linus Raul and Huey had to stay in the suitcase...
