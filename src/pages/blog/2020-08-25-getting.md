We spent a lot of time considering what with regards to resuming travel. A lot of countries were reopening and accepting tourists with varying levels of restrictions but there's still a lot of questions as to how safe travel really is right now and whether or not it was worth the risk. We postponed our decision a few times, once even going so far as to book then cancel a flight, but with Croatia having much lower case numbers than most countries, including the US, throughout the entire pandemic and once they opened up to Americans we decided to go for it.
