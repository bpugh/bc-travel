I struggled with the title for this. "My birthday in Bangkok"? "My grandparents"? "Goodbye"? Something more deep and obscure like talking about facets of a prism? Eventually it all seemed a bit flat, so I went with description.

This morning I woke up to a text that my grandma, Emiko Ambo, had passed away. She had dementia for years prior to this, and was at the end stages to the point of being unable to do or say much. This was not a surprise but I was still surprised at how much the news hurt despite the long gradual journey of grief in the last couple of years.

My grandfather, Genshyo Ambo, had passed away in November of 2018 about a year ago. 

My first feeling upon reading the text was a numbness. Then I cried, a lot. Brandon held me. I called my mom. I talked to my cousin. Then I realized I need to go to McDonald's in the near future. Perhaps not today, but maybe tomorrow. Grandma and Grandpa loved going to McDonald's because it was such a deal, and they'd get the 65 cent senior coffee there too. They would treat me to a happy meal after we all walked down the hill from their Mercer Island house to "downtown" Mercer Island. It would be a wonderful meal. So yes, I am going to need to go to McDonald's soon. Luckily I'm sure Bangkok has a McDonald's.

Let me clarify that I don't want to idealize my grandparents or pretend they were perfect people. Nobody is. However, I can only speak to my personal experiences of those two unique human beings. I know they loved me very deeply, and I loved them so much. I want to commemorate what they meant, looked like, and felt like to their granddaughter, me. It is just one facet of them, one from my perspective.

Their Mercer Island house is the setting of many of my dreams. It is sunny, warm, comforting, and safe. The sunlight streams in through their floor-to-ceiling windows in the upstairs living room, their white leather couches arranged a little differently every time I dream, as they were inclined to keep rearranging furniture monthly. Their gas fireplace is off, since it's sunny. The mantel and shelves have many photos of their kids and grandkids. 

Off to the side of the living room sits a large and grand dining table that has been there since I can remember. They have one of those old style wooden china cabinets filled with, well, china. An open entryway leads to the kitchen, which has a small kitchen table covered with a checkered cloth, and a couple rather ugly looking ceramic containers for sugar and I think one holds Folger's coffee. There is a rather older TV blaring the news perpetually. Over the kitchen sink sits a little figurine, I think of a Peanuts character, at some kind of stand. In my dream, it feels as though my grandparents have just left the house temporarily, and I have no anxiety that they won't return.

Both of my parents worked while i was growing up, so my grandparents ended up babysitting me a lot. Mom would drop me off early in the mornings before she left for work, and I'd watch Sailor Moon in my grandparents' living room before school. Grandma would walk up the hill with me to West Mercer Elementary to drop me off. I would sometimes push her from behind (to help her) and she would laugh. She had gray hair in short curls she would constantly dye herself in the very old very deep basement sink. 

Around September when school would start, we would all go blackberry picking together. Sometimes it would be in the trails right across from their house, but sometimes we'd go farther out like around a park on the Island. Then Grandma would make blackberry pie with the loot. I would watch and try to help, but I never really picked it up from her. One time I asked her to make mochi again so I could learn, and they graciously did just that, soaking the rice extensively, mashing it all up, and showing me how to form the mochi balls while still hot (it kinda burned a bit). Grandma also showed me how to make zenzai, a type of sweet soup made of An (sweet red bean) and in which you can put mochiko balls. I cried when I ate it in Japan a few months ago.
