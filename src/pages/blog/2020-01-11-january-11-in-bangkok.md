The sunlight streams in through their floor-to-ceiling windows in the upstairs living room, their white leather couches arranged a little differently every time I dream, as they were inclined to keep rearranging furniture monthly. Their gas fireplace is off, since it's sunny. The mantel and shelves have many photos of their kids and grandkids. Off to the side of the living room sits a large and grand dining table that has been there since I can remember. They have
