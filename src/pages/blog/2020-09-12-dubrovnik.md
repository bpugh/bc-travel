Our first stop after [Split](https://www.brandonandchris.com/blog/2020-08-21-around-split/) was Dubrovnik.

But first, a quick Croatian geography lesson.

The Neum Corridor is a 9 km long stretch of Bosnia-Herzegovina territory that stands between Central and South Dalmatia. Thanks to the Neum Agreement of 1998, travels are guaranteed free passage from the city of Ploce, Croatia through the Neum and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). We knew none of this at the time and didn't realize that we would be able to cross the border since they had travel restrictions on Americans entering BiH but it turns out that at those border crossing they issue "transit visas" which give you an hour to get through and it generally only take 20 minutes when driving non-stop.

So we ended up taking a more circuitous route taking a car ferry from Ploce to Trpanj on the Peljesac peninsula. The ferry takes about an hour and, thanks to our timing, was more like a pleasant sunset cruise. Sure in total this added about 3 unnecessary hours to our trip but we ended up having a tasty lunch in Ploce while waiting for the ferry and in general driving throughout Croatia is a gorgeously scenic experience. This route in particular takes you along the beautiful Adriatic while winding through high limestone mountains. And we still managed to get into Dubrovnik just after dark.

Our airbnb was located just a short distance up the hill from old town which was fortunate since driving near old town and finding parking is crazy and a huge hassle. So we would walk down and have dinner or wander the streets of old town.

Old town Dubrovnik is an incredibly charming place steeped in history. It constantly felt we stepped into a different era. So much so that more and more movies are being filmed there including, Robin Hood, The Last Jedi, and of course Game of Thrones.

We also had some really amazing food in old town from restaurants like Trattoria Carmen and [Restaurant 360 that we wrote about](https://www.brandonandchris.com/blog/2020-08-30-worthit-restaurant-360-in-dubrovnik/) previously. Not to mention plenty (one could maybe argue and unhealthy amount) of gelato.

Our first order of business was to check out the best nearby beaches. After extensive research, Chris determined that *Sveti Jakov* would be the best one to visit and we were not disappointed. This was our first exposure to the beautiful pebble beaches of the Adriatic sea and we just couldn't get over how clear the water was. The beach is located in the side of a cliff so you have to take some long steep stairs down which is fine except for the nagging thought of having to climb up them later. While the beach was surprisingly crowded with European tourists, we were still able to keep a healthy distance from people.

We decided to hit up one of the lesser-known tourist attractions in the city, the Red Museum. It's a unique little historical museum that gives a fascinating interactive look at everyday life in communist Yugoslavia. It's filled with genuine memorabilia from the period and they even an augmented reality app with some supplemental info. It was a fun way to learn about one of the more recent periods of Croatia's history.

Croatia has lots of beautiful islands and craves near its shores so it's quite popular to take a boat of the surrounding islands while in Dubrovnik. The are plenty of large group tours you can take but since we're trying to *avoid* crowds, we opted for a private tour on a small speedboat. We found a reasonably priced option through Airbnb experiences and we had a great time with our incredibly nice and experienced skipper. We stopped and hiked across one of the smaller islands with some beautiful hidden bays, and got to snorkel in some breathtaking caves.

Dubrovnik is a beautifully unique city and we were so lucky to see.
