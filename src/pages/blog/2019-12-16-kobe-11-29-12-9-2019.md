We spent 10 wonderful days in Kobe, the hometown of two of our friends, Hiromi and Marina. It was so good to see them, and we also had fun seeing the Kobe Luminarie, karaoke, eating Kobe beef, seeing Kobe's chinatown, and going to the Osaka aquarium.

Our airbnb this time was located in a residential area that felt laid back, but was 2 minutes away from a subway station, and only 5-10 minutes by subway to Sannomiya, a central station in Kobe and where most shops/restaurants were located. The house was filled with beautiful tatami. We especially enjoyed the kotatsu, which is a low table covered on the sides by a blanket, and under which the area is heated electrically. The house also had a super cool Japanese bathtub, which had a control panel allowing you to push a button, and it would automatically fill with water and stop itself.

The downside to the two house airbnbs in Japan we have stayed at so far, has been a decentralized heating scheme. Each room has an individual heating/AC unit, so the hallways and bathrooms tend to be freezing in the winter. As someone who pees a lot at night, this took some getting used to.



Later that week we met up with Marina and toured the Kobe Luminarie, a gorgeous lights display in downtown Kobe that also commemorates victims of the Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995. Marina showed us a tasty street food treat consisting of senbei and a fried egg. So messy but so "oishii" (tasty)!!!
