Seoul December 13-20, 2019

The events in this blog update actually took place right before Christmas.

December 13-20, Brandon and I had the opportunity to visit friends in Seoul for a week. We had so much fun catching up with Wonsub, KJ, Jungwoo, JaeAh, and Sangwon. I knew them from my time in Houston around 10 years ago when I did Teach for America. We went to the same church at that time. 

The night after our arrival they took us out to eat at the Korean restaurant pictured above. It was so tasty! They told me it's the same restaurant we came to about 10 years ago when I visited them last time, along with Mary and other friends. It filled my heart right up with joy to see them all again. 

After dinner, they graciously took us to a really cute coffee shop in a trendy area. We talked for hours over warm lattes and mochas, a stark contrast from the freezing cold weather outside. Did I mention Korea was freezing? It was around 1 degree celcius the week we were there. I jokingly called myself "the creampuff" in my puffy white jacket that I picked up from Uniqlo in Japan, just for this week in Korea. Thank you, Marina and Hiromi for convincing me to get it! You guys were lifesavers!

We met up with Sangwon on two other nights and he introduced us to an amazing Italian restaurant called Maremma Trattoria in the Itaewon area. Their bruschetta was actually one of the stars of the night and happened to be huge and shareable. Their steak was also delicious.

After dinner, Sangwon took us to a huge and tasty bakery called Passion Five, also in the Itaewon area. We were overwhelmed and giddy at the many colorful and sugar filled confections. However my favorite ended up being Sangwon's recommendation: the pudding.
