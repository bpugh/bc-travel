November 18-25

Last week we spent some wonderful time in Kyoto again and were visited by Hiromi, a friend I made while she was studying in Houston (10 years ago wow time flies). We had a great time visiting Fushimi Inari again, eating good food, and catching up with her. Then we took another Shinkansen to Tokyo.

**Pro tip:** After doing some research, I discovered it's possible to buy discounted tickets on a slower Shinkansen between Kansai (Kobe, Osaka, Kyoto) area, and Tokyo, on the "Platt Kodama", which takes about 1.5 more hours than the fast Nozomi, but is also $50 cheaper. We trekked all the way to downtown Tokyo just to buy these cheaper tickets in advance, and I think it will end up saving us $300 due to multiple trips.

## Back to Tokyo

This time in Tokyo, we are staying at a studio apartment airbnb on the western side of Tokyo. It's about a 20 minute train ride into central Tokyo, but it also feels more relaxed, and is right by a station and lots of conbinis. However, my motion sickness started to kick in with all the long train rides, despite dramamine, so after going out and about for two days, we're going to take it easy this weekend.
