Sept 28 - Oct 4, 2019

On September 28 we finished our packing for our “Round the world” aka RTW trip, and left to visit family and friends in Seattle. Here’s what my bag looked like (Brandon’s was not available for photography due to sleepless night packing).

We each packed a carry on suitcase and a backpack. I included an empty purse so I could avoid looking like a tourist ALL the time. We also included a dryer line, laundry sheets of detergent, 12 months of birth control (super annoying to obtain in the US), My jewelry roll up case, makeup, toiletries, watercolors, sketchbook, laptop, kindle, meds (ie malarone, antibiotics), our Oculus Quest (virtual reality) system, the three ”chavos” Linus Raul (penguin), Huey (short penguin with bear hat), and Pabu (racoon).

Regarding clothes, I packed:

* 3 pairs of pants
* 1 pair shorts
* 6 pretty camisole tops
* 3 ”going out” tops
* 2 casual tanks
* 3 sets workout shirts/bras/leggings
* 3 dresses
* 1 long sleeved shirt
* 1 man shirt to wear for sleeping
* 1 set sleep t-shirt and shorts
* 1 rain shell
* 1 northface fleece
* 1 KRMA leather jacket
* 10 pairs socks
* 20+ underwears
* 1 pair booties
* 1 pair sandals
* 1 pair tennis shoes

My bags are rather full...

Our airbnb was beautiful in Seattle, with a view overlooking the water and Pike place market.

Seeing family and friends was nice but as always, doesn’t seem long enough. We’ll miss everyone :)

We did our usual pike place circuit of Beecher’s mac and cheese, Ellenos yogurt, Piroshky Piroshky, and that Mee Sum pastry for humbow.
