We are 2 months behind on blogging so please forgive the vagueness of some descriptions.

After Bangkok, Brandon and I spent a week in Boracay in the Philippines. It's famous for their white sand beach and recently underwent a huge cleanup effort by the government involving shutting the entire island down for months. Compared to pictures I saw, it was indeed gorgeous and clean when we visited. We stayed at a beachfront hotel called Villa Caemilla that I found on tripadvisor. It was small, did not have a pool, but its best feature was the restaurant in front for the ocean. Cheap pina coladas, free painting classes, and a cultural dance show were included.
