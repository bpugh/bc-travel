Boracay: January 14-23, 2020

Changi airport: January 23-25, 2020

We are 2 months behind on blogging so please forgive the vagueness of some descriptions.

After Bangkok, Brandon and I spent a week in Boracay in the Philippines. It's famous for their white sand beach and recently underwent a huge cleanup effort by the government involving shutting the entire island down for months. Compared to pictures I saw, it was indeed gorgeous and clean when we visited. We stayed at a beachfront hotel called Villa Caemilla that I found on tripadvisor. It was small, did not have a pool, but its best feature was the restaurant in front for the ocean. Cheap pina coladas, free painting classes, and a cultural dance show were included.

Overall it was a lovely stay and wins our vote for best sunsets we've ever seen in our lives. However, I think our later travels to Koh Lipe had better swimming at the beach. It's also incredibly far away from the states, so most of our compatriots were Europeans. 

\-----------------

Our flight into Boracay was routed through NAIA airport in Manila. It's rated as one of the worst airports in the world and we got to see firsthand why. At least half of it is outdoors in the muggy heat, and a huge portion was undergoing renovation while we were there, with unfinished scaffolding and confusing signs trying to lead passengers to their destination. It was so confusing though, that getting lost and needing directions was almost inevitable. 

Furthermore, we had to transfer terminals and had no idea where to get the shuttle that supposedly connects the two. A lady in official looking airport uniform that even had the airport logo and her position embroidered on it, stopped us and tried to convince us to pay a lot of money for a shuttle that would arrive "much faster" than the normal one. She also tried to get us to pay for a special lounge. We finally concluded this must be a scam and declined.

Eventually we found a bus to take us to the next terminal but it may not have been the official one after all. It was sketchy AF, old and worn with self sewn cloths hanging down, patched up sides, and creaky groans as it moved. It looked like a renovated (and falling apart) school bus. Then it stopped randomly at intersections and picked people up and dropped them off to places on the way that had nothing to do with the airport. When we finally disembarked, we were charged money to have taken this "official" airport transport. If it was a scam, at least it was a smaller one.

\------------------

In contrast, upon leaving Boracay we went spent two nights at Changi Airport in Singapore, consistently winning awards for being one of the best in the world.
