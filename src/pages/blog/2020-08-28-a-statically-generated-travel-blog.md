I set out to make this travel blog one that would provide a pleasant reading experience, and be free to maintain indefinitely. After some deliberation, I settled on building a statically generated site built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
Below I'll explain why I chose the technologies I did and go into some detail about how I went about creating the site.
